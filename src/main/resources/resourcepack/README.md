BlindChase Resource Pack (outline)

This folder contains a minimal outline for a client resource pack that provides a custom texture for the White Cane (a stick with CustomModelData=10001).

How to use:
- Place your texture file at `assets/blindchase/textures/item/white_cane.png` (512x512 or 256x256 recommended, PNG format with transparency if needed).
- Zip the content of the `resourcepack` folder (zip the children, not the folder itself) so the archive root contains `pack.mcmeta` and `assets/`.
- Distribute the ZIP to players or place it in your Minecraft `resourcepacks` folder and enable it in-game.

Notes:
- The override is configured on vanilla `stick` with `CustomModelData: 10001`.
- Namespace used here is `blindchase`.
